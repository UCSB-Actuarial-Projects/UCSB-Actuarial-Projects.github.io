												<h2>My Aon Internship Experience in Summer 2022</h2>
                        <h3>by Aaron Widjaja</h3>
											</header>
<p>My Summer 2022 internship at Aon has been a memorable and fulfilling experience as an aspiring actuary. Back in May, I applied quite late to the internship because there was an unexpected opening. At that time, I had just passed my second exam (FM) so I thought nothing of it and applied to see if I would land the position or not. I am currently still interning at Aon on an extension until the end of the school year 2023 when I graduate. If there is something to take away, it is to not shy away from opportunities and apply to as many positions as you can. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
Going into my internship, I really did not know what to expect. However, taking PSTAT 183 the quarter before my internship was tremendously helpful. The class gave me a stronger understanding of the duties of an Actuary and of our profession. Thank you, Professor Janet Duncan!
                      </p>
                      <p>
I utilized Aon’s Actuarial Modeling Suite, Actuarial Value Model, and IBNP Triangle for analysis to determine how a client’s plan is performing relative to budget/premium and how to maximize client value. On top of my regular duties, I teamed up with a cohort of other regional interns to present on behalf of the Aon story. This internship had a broad variety of experiences that allowed me to hone my technical and soft skills. Whether it was working on updating models to presenting in front of fellow colleagues and leaders, I would highly recommend Aon to anyone. 
                      </p><p>
Aon is a place where I can grow professionally and personally while I work towards achieving my goals. At Aon, the work culture and collaborative environment are like none other. I value working at a place where colleagues cheer each other on and achieve success together. The work being done at Aon helping each individual client truly inspires me and is something that I look forward to every day.
                      </p>
                      <p>
