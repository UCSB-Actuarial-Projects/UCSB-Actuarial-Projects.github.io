                        <h2><i>Coaching Actuaries</i> and the new actuarial exams</h2>
                        <h3>by Marie Borac</h3>
											</header>

<p> <i>Coaching Actuaries</i> is, of course, the premier provider of coaching classes for actuaries who aspire to obtain an associateship - either as an SOA member or as a CAS member.
</p>
<p>Recently, the SOA and the CAS have changed the examination sillabi and the sequence of the exams. This has been a rather large change for all of us who had planned their studies around the eventual goal of becoming an Associate of one of the two major US associations.
A number of actuarial classes within UCSB have syllabi that parallel those of the actuarial exams. Naturally, these sillabi have suddenly become obsolete and the faculty has had to restructure the material taught in several classes.</p>
<p>Luckily for our members, <i>Coaching Actuaries</i> has reacted promptly providing updated sillabi and materials for the new exams! This has been and continues to be of great help to all our association members who were preparing for exams, especially for exams P and FM.</p>
<p>When the changes happened, I had already passed my two first exams but I continued to experience the unparalleled support of <i>Coaching Actuaries</i> as a teaching assistant for classes such as PSTAT 182T and PSTAT 171.</p>
<p>Few of our members know that <i>Coaching Actuaries</i> has a program that helps instructors use their extensive problem banks to create assignments and to provide students with strong, targeted materials for their exam preparation.</p>
<p>However, as soon as the Winter Quarter 2023, we will start using CAiC (<i>Coaching Actuaries in Class</i>) - a program designed specifically to support university classes.</p>
<p>This program will also offer very deep discounts on the additional features of the <i>Coaching Actuaries</i> platform to all enrolled students, whether they are Association members or not. Such features are not only very popular among aspiring actuaries but also impressively useful! Many students have told us that the 'Adapt' feature has been a lifesaver!</p>
<p>Providing preparation for Exams P and FM in alternate quarters, the Actuarial Seminar PSTAT 182T will provide CAiC assignments and benefit from the superb <i>Coaching Actuaries</i> study timeline and syllabus. Enroll in PSTAT 182T to obtain all these wonderful benefits!</p>
